# Inform 6

Inform 6 is a compiler for interactive fiction (text adventure games), written by Graham Nelson.

Back in the late 1980s, people began investigating the format of Infocom's text adventures. Infocom used a standard format that defined a virtual machine, which has come to be known as the Z-Machine, to allow them to be able to port their games to many different computers. This investigation lead to the creation of open source implementations of the Z-Machine, such as the InfoTaskForce interpreter, Zip, Frotz, and many others.

In 1993, Graham Nelson released the first version of Inform, which compiled a somewhat C-like language ("Inform") to the Z-Machine. In the years that followed this led to the creation of hundreds of free games by a community that had sprung up based around the Usenet group rec.arts.int-fiction.

The latest version of Inform is [Inform 7](http://inform7.com/), but Inform 6 still lives on, both as the code generator used by Inform 7, and as a language and compiler in its own right. Inform 6 is now considered stable and only has bugs fixed and minor, non-breaking features added, but development continues.

## Using Inform 6

To use the compiler, you will need an executable. There are [pre-built executables](https://ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archive/infocom/compilers/inform6/executables/) available, or you can compile the source yourself. There is no makefile as compilation does not really need one: all that is required is a C compiler and for it to be invoked with something like

      cc -O2 -o inform *.c
      
To write a work of interactive fiction with Inform 6, you will also need a version of the Inform 6 library. [Stable versions](https://ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archive/infocom/compilers/inform6/library/) of the library are available, and development of the library continues in a [separate project](https://gitlab.com/DavidGriffith/inform6lib).

More resources and documentation, including the Inform Designer's Manual, are available from the [Inform 6 web site](https://www.inform-fiction.org/).
